# logIn-interface-java-swings

This project is done to show how to make a desktop login application using java swings and applying the MVC architecture and how to get the json data inside the json file using some dependencies.
## Features of the project
* Easy and simple to use
* It validates if the username and password are empty or not before it starts the log-in process
* If the username and password are not empty, it tries to log-in
* It encrypts password before it tries it compares it to stored password and username
* If the password or the username is invalid, it will show the notification that they are invalid if not it will show that the log-in is successfully by notification that says so
* This application compares the username and password of the user with the ones that are in a json file in the resource folder
* The correct credentials are: username = admin, password = password@12345
* This interface has the labels that act as placeholders in the fields and move up words when the user enters something on the field or hovers over that field

## Interface for LogIn
This is the log-in interface after the application is lunched.
